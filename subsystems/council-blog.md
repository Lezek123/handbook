## Introduction

Using the proposal system blogpost can be made and edited. Members can reply to posts and also to replies making it a nested reply system. Posts can be locked and unlocked through the proposal system, when a post is locked no new replies can be created. Also, replies can be either editable or non-editable, editable replies can be edited throughout their lifetime, they require a deposit which is returned when you make it no longer editable through the `delete_reply` extrinsic.

## Roles

The relevant actors in the forum are

* **Member:** members reply to posts or replies by other users.

## Concepts
